# Abstract

In order to better understand the data processing framework and computing algorithms, besides school work, 
I completed additional courses on DataCamp, including Python, SQL, AWS, and Spark.

Through the study here, I have mastered the basic syntax, working principle and applicable environment of each technique, 
helping me better prepare to become a Data Engineer.
